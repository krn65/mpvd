16,CWE CATEGORY: Configuration,Weaknesses in this category are typically introduced during the configuration of the software.
20,CWE-20: Improper Input Validation,"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly."
79,CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
94,CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'),"The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment."
119,CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,"The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer."
189,CWE CATEGORY: Numeric Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper calculation or conversion of numbers.
200,CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
264,"CWE CATEGORY: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls","Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control."
275,CWE CATEGORY: Permission Issues,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper assignment or handling of permissions.
287,CWE-287: Improper Authentication,"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct."
310,CWE CATEGORY: Cryptographic Issues,"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and implementation of data confidentiality and integrity. Frequently these deal with the use of encoding techniques, encryption libraries, and hashing algorithms. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data if they are not addressed."
311,CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data,The software does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.
326,CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength,"The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required."
399,CWE CATEGORY: Resource Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper management of system resources.
416,CWE-416: Use After Free,"Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code."
787,CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write,"The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer."
