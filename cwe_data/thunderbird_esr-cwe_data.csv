20,CWE-20: Improper Input Validation,"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly."
74,CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'),"The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component."
79,CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
94,CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'),"The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment."
119,CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,"The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data."
120,CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'),"The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
125,CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read,"The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer."
189,CWE CATEGORY: Numeric Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper calculation or conversion of numbers.
190,CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound,"The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may become a very small or negative number."
200,CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
264,"CWE CATEGORY: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls","Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control."
269,CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management,"The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor."
287,CWE-287: Improper Authentication,"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct."
295,CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation,"The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate."
311,CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data,The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.
326,CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength,"The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required."
346,CWE-346: Origin Validation Error,The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.
399,CWE CATEGORY: Resource Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper management of system resources.
416,CWE-416: Use After Free,"The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory ""belongs"" to the code that operates on the new pointer."
682,CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation,The product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.
787,CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write,"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer."
