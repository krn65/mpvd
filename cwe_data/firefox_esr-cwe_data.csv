17,CWE CATEGORY: DEPRECATED: Code,"This entry has been deprecated. It was originally used for organizing the Development View (CWE-699) and some other views, but it introduced unnecessary complexity and depth to the resulting tree."
19,CWE CATEGORY: Data Processing Errors,Weaknesses in this category are typically found in functionality that processes data. Data processing is the manipulation of input to retrieve or save information.
20,CWE-20: Improper Input Validation,"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly."
22,CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'),"The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory."
74,CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'),"The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component."
77,CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'),"The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component."

290,CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing,This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.
295,CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation,"The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate."
310,CWE CATEGORY: Cryptographic Issues,"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and implementation of data confidentiality and integrity. Frequently these deal with the use of encoding techniques, encryption libraries, and hashing algorithms. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data if they are not addressed."

362,CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'),"The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently."
367,CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition,"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state."
388,CWE CATEGORY: 7PK - Errors,"This category represents one of the phyla in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms vulnerability classification. It includes weaknesses that occur when an application does not properly handle errors that occur during processing. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, ""Errors and error handling represent a class of API. Errors related to error handling are so common that they deserve a special kingdom of their own. As with 'API Abuse,' there are two ways to introduce an error-related security vulnerability: the most common one is handling errors poorly (or not at all). The second is producing errors that either give out too much information (to possible attackers) or are difficult to handle."""
399,CWE CATEGORY: Resource Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper management of system resources.

835,CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop'),"The product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop."
843,CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion'),"The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type."
863,CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization,"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions."
909,CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource,The product does not initialize a critical resource.
922,CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information,The product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.
