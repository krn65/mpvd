20,CWE-20: Improper Input Validation,"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly."
79,CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
119,CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,"The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer."
120,CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'),"The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
125,CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read,"The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer."
200,CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
264,"CWE CATEGORY: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls","Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control."
276,CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions,"The product, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor."
295,CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation,"The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate."
345,CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity,"The software does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data."
352,CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),"The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request."
354,CWE-354: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value,"The software does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or ""checksums"" of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission."
362,CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'),"The program contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently."
416,CWE-416: Use After Free,"Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code."
665,CWE-665: Improper Initialization,"The software does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used."
704,CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast,"The software does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type."
732,CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource,The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.
829,CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere,"The software imports, requires, or includes executable functionality (such as a library) from a source that is outside of the intended control sphere."
