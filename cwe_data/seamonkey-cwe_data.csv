16,CWE CATEGORY: Configuration,Weaknesses in this category are typically introduced during the configuration of the software.
17,CWE CATEGORY: DEPRECATED: Code,"This entry has been deprecated. It was originally used for organizing the Development View (CWE-699) and some other views, but it introduced unnecessary complexity and depth to the resulting tree."
20,CWE-20: Improper Input Validation,"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly."
22,CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'),"The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory."
59,CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'),"The software attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource."
79,CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
91,CWE-91: XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection),"The software does not properly neutralize special elements that are used in XML, allowing attackers to modify the syntax, content, or commands of the XML before it is processed by an end system."
94,CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'),"The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment."
119,CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,"The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer."
189,CWE CATEGORY: Numeric Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper calculation or conversion of numbers.
199,CWE CATEGORY: Information Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper handling of sensitive information.
200,CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
254,CWE CATEGORY: 7PK - Security Features,"Software security is not security software. Here we're concerned with topics like authentication, access control, confidentiality, cryptography, and privilege management."
255,CWE CATEGORY: Credentials Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of credentials.
264,"CWE CATEGORY: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls","Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control."
284,CWE-284: Improper Access Control,The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.
287,CWE-287: Improper Authentication,"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct."
310,CWE CATEGORY: Cryptographic Issues,"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and implementation of data confidentiality and integrity. Frequently these deal with the use of encoding techniques, encryption libraries, and hashing algorithms. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data if they are not addressed."
352,CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),"The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request."
362,CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'),"The program contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently."
399,CWE CATEGORY: Resource Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper management of system resources.
