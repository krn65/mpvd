CVE-2022-45411,Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5 Thunderbird < 102.5 and Firefox < 107.
CVE-2022-45410,When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code> the origin of the request was lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it.

CVE-2022-40674,libexpat before 2.4.9 has a use-after-free in the doContent function in xmlparse.c.
CVE-2022-39251,Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow for example to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. Starting with version 19.7.0 matrix-js-sdk has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.
CVE-2022-39250,Matrix JavaScript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server software development kit (SDK) for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could interfere with the verification flow between two users injecting its own cross-signing user identity in place of one of the users&#8217; identities. This would lead to the other device trusting/verifying the user identity under the control of the homeserver instead of the intended one. The vulnerability is a bug in the matrix-js-sdk caused by checking and signing user identities and devices in two separate steps and inadequately fixing the keys to be signed between those steps. Even though the attack is partly made possible due to the design decision of treating cross-signing user identities as Matrix devices on the server side (with their device ID set to the public part of the user identity key) no other examined implementations were vulnerable. Starting with version 19.7.0 the matrix-js-sdk has been modified to double check that the key signed is the one that was verified instead of just referencing the key by ID. An additional check has been made to report an error when one of the device ID matches a cross-signing key. As this attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker those who trust their homeservers do not need a particular workaround.
CVE-2022-39249,Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0 an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end. Starting with version 19.7.0 the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately for example by showing a warning for such messages. This attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker and those who trust your homeservers do not need a workaround.
CVE-2022-39236,Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1 improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events waiting for the sync processor to store data and restarting the client are possible workarounds. Alternatively redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an unaffected version noting that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities will additionally resolve the issue.

CVE-2022-24713,regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.

This could have been used by an attacker to send an email message with the attacker's digital signature that was shown with an arbitrary sender email address chosen by the attacker. If the sender name started with a false email address followed by many Braille space characters the attacker's email address was not visible. Because Thunderbird compared the invisible sender address with the signature's email address if the signing key or certificate was accepted by Thunderbird the email was shown as having a valid digital signature. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10.
CVE-2022-1802,If an attacker was able to corrupt the methods of an Array object in JavaScript via prototype pollution they could have achieved execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript code in a privileged context.
