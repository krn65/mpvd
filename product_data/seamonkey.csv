02.4,['CVE-2011-3670'],2012-02,Overly permissive IPv6 literal syntax,Gregory Fleischer,Low,For historical reasons Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web addresses containing square brackets around the host. If this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address Firefox attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name. Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were previously accepted.,[504014]

Instead the NSS client will take the EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation the browser thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange but has been silently downgraded to a non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result if False Start is enabled the browser will start sending data encrypted under these non-forward-secret connection keys. This issue was fixed in NSS version 3.19.1.,[1086145]

The first use-after-free problem is caused when an array of nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but attempts are made to call into objects in this array later. The second use-after-free problem is in nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document and then adopts into another document emptying the first one. The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are dereferenced. The bad cast happens when nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.,"[752902, 765139, 765218, 759249]"
02.11,['CVE-2012-1955'],2012-45,Spoofing issue with location,Mariusz Mlynski,High,Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the location property. In this issue calls to history.forward and history.back are used to navigate to a site while displaying the previous site in the addressbar but changing the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used for phishing by allowing the user to input form or other data on the newer attacking site while appearing to be on the older displayed site.,[757376]
02.11,['CVE-2012-1957'],2012-47,Improper filtering of javascript in HTML feed-view,Mario Heiderich,High,Security researcher Mario Heiderich reported that javascript could be executed in the HTML feed-view using <embed> tag within the RSS <description>. This problem is due to <embed> tags not being filtered out during parsing and can lead to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The flaw existed in a parser utility class and could affect other parts of the browser or add-ons which rely on that class to sanitize untrusted input.,[750096]
02.11,['CVE-2012-1958'],2012-48,use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden,Arthur Gerkis,Moderate,Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find a use-after-free in nsGlobalWindow::PageHidden when mFocusedContent is released and oldFocusedContent is used afterwards. This use-after-free could possibly allow for remote code execution.,[750820]
02.11,['CVE-2012-1959'],2012-49,Same-compartment Security Wrappers can be bypassed,Bobby Holley,Critical,Mozilla developer Bobby Holley found that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment. Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW but have a filtering policy built into them. When an object is wrapped cross-compartment the SCSW is stripped off and when the object is read read back it is not known that SCSW was previously present resulting in a bypassing of SCSW. This could result in untrusted content having access to the XBL that implements browser functionality.,"[754044, 737559]"

This duplication occurs for unknown reasons on some websites and when it occurs results in Mozilla browsers not being protected against possible clickjacking attacks on those pages",[761655]
02.11,['CVE-2012-1962'],2012-52,JSDependentString::undepend string conversion results in memory corruption,Bill Keese,Critical,Security researcher Bill Keese reported a memory corruption. This is caused by JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string into a fixed string when there are additional dependent strings relying on the same base. When the undepend occurs during conversion the base data is freed leaving other dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash.,[764296]

CSP violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the ""report-uri"" location include sensitive data within the ""blocked-uri"" parameter. These include fragment components and query strings even if the ""blocked-uri"" parameter has a different origin than the protected resource. This can be used to retrieve a user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials by malicious sites.",[767778]
02.11,['CVE-2012-1967'],2012-56,Code execution through javascript: URLs,moz_bug_r_a4,Critical,Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a arbitrary code execution attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko engine features a JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or add-ons to safely execute script in the context of a web page. In certain cases javascript: URLs are executed in such a sandbox with insufficient context that can allow those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.,[758344]

A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate error warning page (about:certerror) with the ""Add Exception"" button of a real warning page from a malicious site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate exception for a different site than the perceived one. This can lead to compromised communications with the user perceived site through the MITM attack once the certificate exception has been added.",[633691]

The first heap buffer overflow was found in conversion from unicode to native character sets when the function fails. The use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList when working with column layout with absolute positioning in a container that changes size. The second buffer overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState when a window is resized on a page with nested columns and a combination of absolute and relative positioning. All three of these issues are potentially exploitable.,"[744541, 747688, 750066]"
02.10,['CVE-2012-0441'],2012-39,NSS parsing errors with zero length items,Kaspar Brand,Moderate,Security researcher Kaspar Brand found a flaw in how the Network Security Services (NSS) ASN.1 decoder handles zero length items. Effects of this issue depend on the field. One known symptom is an unexploitable crash in handling OCSP responses. NSS also mishandles zero-length basic constraints assuming default values for some types that should be rejected as malformed. These issues have been addressed in NSS 3.13.4 which is now being used by Mozilla.,[715073]

Web applications relying on this feature of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not fully protected.,[751422]
02.10,"['CVE-2012-1942', 'CVE-2012-1943']",2012-35,Privilege escalation through Mozilla Updater and Windows Updater Service,James Forshaw,Critical,Security researcher James Forshaw of Context Information Security found two issues with the Mozilla updater and the Mozilla updater service introduced in Firefox 12 for Windows. The first issue allows Mozilla's updater to load a local DLL file in a privileged context. The updater can be called by the Updater Service or independently on systems that do not use the service. The second of these issues allows for the updater service to load an arbitrary local DLL file which can then be run with the same system privileges used by the service. Both of these issues require local file system access to be exploitable.,"[748764, 750850]"
