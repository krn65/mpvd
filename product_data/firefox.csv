82,['CVE-2020-15254'],2020-45,Undefined behavior in bounded channel of crossbeam rust crate,Caelum van Ispelen,high,In the crossbeam rust crate the bounded channel incorrectly assumed that Vec::from_iter had allocated capacity that was the same as the number of iterator elements. Vec::from_iter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions - this is unsound and caused a deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from_iter had allocated different sizes than the number of iterator elements. The impact on Firefox is undetermined but in another use case the behavior was causing corruption of jemalloc structures.,[1668514]

This can occur if the password input field has a scripted mechanism to display the password to the user. Once this type is changed the password data will persist as clear text within stored form data for this page. This could result in a potential revelation of site passwords on sites that use this mechanism to display password data if an attacker could find a way to read the session restoration file.",[1280294]

47,['CVE-2016-2822'],2016-52,Addressbar spoofing though the SELECT element,Jordi Chancel,Moderate,Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported a method to spoof the contents of the addressbar. This uses a persistent menu within a <select> element which acts as a container for HTML content and can be placed in an arbitrary location.  When placed over the addressbar this can mask the true site URL allowing for spoofing by a malicious site.,[1273129]

47,['CVE-2016-2826'],2016-55,File overwrite and privilege escalation through Mozilla Windows updater,Frédéric Hoguin,High,Security researcher Frédéric Hoguin reported a mechanism where the Mozilla Windows updater could be used to overwrite arbitrary files. He found that files extracted by the updater from a MAR archive are not locked for writing and can be overwritten by other processes while the updater is running. A malicious local program could invoke the updater and then interfere with the extracted files replacing them with its own. This vulnerability could be used for privilege escalation if these overwritten files were later invoked by other Windows components that had higher privileges.,[1237219]
47,['CVE-2016-2829'],2016-57,Incorrect icon displayed on permissions notifications,Tim McCormack,Low,Security researcher Tim McCormack reported that when a page requests a series of permissions in a short timespan the resulting permission notifications can show the icon for the wrong permission request. This can lead to user confusion and inadvertent consent given when a user is prompted by web content to give permissions such as for geolocation or microphone access.,[1248329]
47,['CVE-2016-2831'],2016-58,Entering fullscreen and persistent pointerlock without user permission,sushi Anton Larsson,High,Security researcher sushi Anton Larsson reported that when paired fullscreen and pointerlock requests are done in combination with closing windows a pointerlock can be created within a fullscreen window without user permission. This pointerlock cannot then be cancelled without terminating the browser resulting in a persistent denial of service attack. This can also be used for spoofing and clickjacking attacks against the browser UI.,[1261933]

This can be used for information disclosure through a fingerprinting attack that lists all of the plugins installed by a user on a system even when they are disabled.,[1025267]
47,['CVE-2016-2833'],2016-60,Java applets bypass CSP protections,Matt Wobensmith,Moderate,Mozilla engineer Matt Wobensmith reported that Content Security Policy (CSP) does not block the loading of cross-domain Java applets when specified by policy. This is because the Java applet is loaded by the Java plugin which then mediates all network requests without checking against CSP. This could allow a malicious site to manipulate content through a Java applet to bypass CSP protections allowing for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.,[908933]

42,['CVE-2015-4515'],2015-117,Information disclosure through NTLM authentication,Tim Brown,Low,Security researcher Tim Brown reported that Firefox discloses the hostname and possibly the Windows domain through NTLM-based HTTP authentication when sending type 3 messages as part of the authentication exchange. This is because the Workstation field is populated with the hostname of the system making the request. An attacker can craft a malicious page to send a silent NTLM request that will disclose the information without visibility in the client leading to information disclosure. This is mitigated because NTLM v1 is disabled by default configurations.,[1046421]

40.0.3,['CVE-2015-4498'],2015-95,Add-on notification bypass through data URLs,Bas Venis,High,Security researcher Bas Venis reported a mechanism where add-ons could be installed from a different source than user expectations. Normally when a user enters the URL to an add-on directly in the addressbar warning prompts are bypassed because it is the result of direct user action. He discovered that a data: URL could be manipulated on a loaded page to simulate this direct user input of the add-on's URL which would result in a bypassing of the install permission prompt. He also reported that in the absence of the permission prompt it is possible to cause the actual installation prompt to appear above another site's location by causing a page navigation immediately after triggering add-on installation.

39,['CVE-2015-2721'],2015-71,NSS incorrectly permits skipping of ServerKeyExchange,Karthikeyan Bhargavan,Moderate,Security researcher Karthikeyan Bhargavan reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) where the client allows for a ECDHE_ECDSA exchange where the server does not send its ServerKeyExchange message instead of aborting the handshake. Instead the NSS client will take the EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation the browser thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange but has been silently downgraded to a non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result if False Start is enabled the browser will start sending data encrypted under these non-forward-secret connection keys. This issue was fixed in NSS version 3.19.1.,[1086145]
39,['CVE-2015-4000'],2015-70,NSS accepts export-length DHE keys with regular DHE cipher suites,"Matthew Green, authors of the paper",Moderate,"Security researcher Matthew Green reported a Diffie–Hellman (DHE) key processing issue in Network Security Services (NSS) where a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can force a server to downgrade TLS connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography by modifying client requests to include only export-grade cipher suites. The resulting weak key can then be leveraged to impersonate the server. This attack is detailed in the ""Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice"" paper and is known as the ""Logjam Attack.""",[1138554]

39,['CVE-2015-2741'],2015-67,Key pinning is ignored when overridable errors are encountered,David Keeler,Moderate,Mozilla security engineer David Keeler reported that when an overridable error is encountered such as those for expired certificates or a host name does not match a certificate pinning checks can be be skipped. This would allow for a user to override a pinned certificate when they should not be able to do so. This issue does not allow for third parties to cause a certificate to be overridden and the user would still have to manually do so.,[1147497]

Only same-origin inheritance is allowed according to the HTML5 specification. This issue allows an attacker to add content that will be interpreted one way on the victim site but which may then behave differently evading cross-site scripting (XSS) filtering when forced into an unexpected character set. Web site authors should always explicitly declare a character encoding to avoid similar issues.,[871161]

23,['CVE-2013-1712'],2013-71,Further Privilege escalation through Mozilla Updater,Ash,High,Security researcher Ash reported an issue with the Mozilla Updater on Windows 7 and later versions of Windows. On vulnerable platforms the Mozilla Updater can be made to load a specific malicious DLL file from the local system. This DLL file can run in a privileged context through the Mozilla Maintenance Service's privileges allowing for local privilege escalation. The DLL file can also run in an unprivileged context if the Mozilla Updater is run directly by a user in the same directory as the file.
