This is because the Workstation field is populated with the hostname of the system making the request. An attacker can craft a malicious page to send a silent NTLM request that will disclose the information without visibility in the client leading to information disclosure. This is mitigated because NTLM v1 is disabled by default configurations.,[1046421]

40.0.3,['CVE-2015-4498'],2015-95,Add-on notification bypass through data URLs,Bas Venis,High,Security researcher Bas Venis reported a mechanism where add-ons could be installed from a different source than user expectations. Normally when a user enters the URL to an add-on directly in the addressbar warning prompts are bypassed because it is the result of direct user action. He discovered that a data: URL could be manipulated on a loaded page to simulate this direct user input of the add-on's URL which would result in a bypassing of the install permission prompt. He also reported that in the absence of the permission prompt it is possible to cause the actual installation prompt to appear above another site's location by causing a page navigation immediately after triggering add-on installation. This could manipulate a user into falsely believing a trusted site (such as addons.mozilla.org) has initiated the installation. This could lead to users installing an add-on from a malicious source.,[1042699]

40,['CVE-2015-4490'],2015-91,Mozilla Content Security Policy allows for asterisk wildcards in violation of CSP specification,Christoph Kerschbaumer,Moderate,Mozilla security engineer Christoph Kerschbaumer reported a discrepancy in Mozilla's implementation of Content Security Policy and the CSP specification. The specification states that blob: data: and filesystem: URLs should be excluded in case of a wildcard when matching source expressions but Mozilla's implementation allows these in the case of an asterisk wildcard. This could allow for more permissive CSP usage than expected by a web developer possibly allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.,[1086999]

40,['CVE-2015-4481'],2015-84,Arbitrary file overwriting through Mozilla Maintenance Service with hard links,James Forshaw,High,Security researcher James Forshaw security researcher with Google Project Zero reported that the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows can be made to write its log file in a restricted location with an arbitrary file name through the use of a hard link by means of a race condition. This can allow the log file to overwrite another named file that a user would not have the privileges to change. If the overwritten file is used as source input or script by a program with elevated privileges it could allow for an escalation of privilege attack. This requires local file system access and the ability to execute local programs to be exploitable.,[1171518]

39,['CVE-2015-2721'],2015-71,NSS incorrectly permits skipping of ServerKeyExchange,Karthikeyan Bhargavan,Moderate,Security researcher Karthikeyan Bhargavan reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) where the client allows for a ECDHE_ECDSA exchange where the server does not send its ServerKeyExchange message instead of aborting the handshake. Instead the NSS client will take the EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation the browser thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange but has been silently downgraded to a non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result if False Start is enabled the browser will start sending data encrypted under these non-forward-secret connection keys. This issue was fixed in NSS version 3.19.1.,[1086145]

As Armin Razmdjou reported for that issue opening hyperlinks on a page with the mouse and specific keyboard key combinations could allow a Chrome privileged URL to be opened without context restrictions being preserved.

37.0.1,['CVE-2015-0798'],2015-43,Loading privileged content through Reader mode,Armin Razmdjou,High,Security researcher Armin Razmdjou reported a flaw in Reader mode on Firefox for Android. Reader mode reformats web content for easy readability and operates as unprivileged content that is the equivalent of the formatted content. When Reader mode is unable to process content it displays the original web pages. Since it is unprivileged there are no restrictions on pages linking to or framing Reader mode content.

07,['CVE-2011-3000'],2011-39,Defense against multiple Location headers due to CRLF Injection,Ian Graham,Moderate,Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that when multiple Location headers were present in a redirect response  Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers: Mozilla would use the second Location header while Chrome and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two copies of this header with different values could be a symptom of a CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most commonly it is the Location header itself that is vulnerable to the response splitting and therefore the copy preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be the malicious one. It is possible however that the first copy was the injected one depending on the nature of the server vulnerability.,[655389]
