The resulting weak key can then be leveraged to impersonate the server. This attack is detailed in the ""Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice"" paper and is known as the ""Logjam Attack.""",[1138554]
02.2,['CVE-2015-2721'],2015-71,NSS incorrectly permits skipping of ServerKeyExchange,Karthikeyan Bhargavan,Moderate,Security researcher Karthikeyan Bhargavan reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) where the client allows for a ECDHE_ECDSA exchange where the server does not send its ServerKeyExchange message instead of aborting the handshake. Instead the NSS client will take the EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation the browser thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange but has been silently downgraded to a non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result if False Start is enabled the browser will start sending data encrypted under these non-forward-secret connection keys. This issue was fixed in NSS version 3.19.1.,[1086145]
