17.0.8,['CVE-2013-1717'],2013-75,Local Java applets may read contents of local file system,"Georgi Guninski, John Schoenick",High,Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported an issue with Java applets where in some circumstances the applet could access files on the local system when loaded using the a file:/// URI and violate file origin policy due to interaction with the codebase parameter. This affects applets running on the local file system. Mozilla developer John Schoenick later discovered that fixes for this issue were inadequate and allowed the invocation of Java applets to bypass security checks in additional circumstances. This could lead to untrusted Java applets having read-only access on the local files system if used in conjunction with a method to download a file to a known or guessable path.,"[406541, 738396]"
17.0.8,['CVE-2013-1714'],2013-73,Same-origin bypass with web workers and XMLHttpRequest,Federico Lanusse,High,Mozilla community member Federico Lanusse reported a mechanism where a web worker can violate same-origin policy and bypass cross-origin checks through XMLHttpRequest.

17.0.8,['CVE-2013-1712'],2013-71,Further Privilege escalation through Mozilla Updater,Ash,High,Security researcher Ash reported an issue with the Mozilla Updater on Windows 7 and later versions of Windows. On vulnerable platforms the Mozilla Updater can be made to load a specific malicious DLL file from the local system. This DLL file can run in a privileged context through the Mozilla Maintenance Service's privileges allowing for local privilege escalation.

Local file system access is necessary in order for this issue to be exploitable.,[859072]
17.0.8,['CVE-2013-1710'],2013-69,CRMF requests allow for code execution and XSS attacks,moz_bug_r_a4,Critical,Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a mechanism to execute arbitrary code or a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack when Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request is generated in certain circumstances.,[871368]
17.0.8,['CVE-2013-1709'],2013-68,Document URI misrepresentation and masquerading,moz_bug_r_a4,High,Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that through an interaction of frames and browser history it was possible to make the browser believe attacker-supplied content came from the location of a previous page in browser history. This allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by loading scripts from a misrepresented malicious site through relative locations and the potential access of stored credentials of a spoofed site.,[848253]
17.0.8,"['CVE-2013-1706', 'CVE-2013-1707']",2013-66,Buffer overflow in Mozilla Maintenance Service and Mozilla Updater,Seb Patane,High,Security researcher Seb Patane reported stack buffer overflows in both the Maintenance Service and the Mozilla Updater when unexpectedly long paths were encountered.

17.0.7,['CVE-2013-1697'],2013-59,XrayWrappers can be bypassed to run user defined methods in a privileged context,moz_bug_r_a4,High,Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that XrayWrappers can be bypassed to call content-defined toString and valueOf methods through DefaultValue. This can lead to unexpected behavior when privileged code acts on the incorrect values.,[858101]
17.0.7,['CVE-2013-1694'],2013-56,PreserveWrapper has inconsistent behavior,Boris Zbarsky,High,Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky found that when PreserveWrapper was used in cases where a wrapper is not set the preserved-wrapper flag on the wrapper cache is cleared. This could potentially lead to an exploitable crash.,[848535]
17.0.7,['CVE-2013-1693'],2013-55,SVG filters can lead to information disclosure,Paul Stone,High,Security researcher Paul Stone of Context Information Security discovered that timing differences in the processing of SVG format images with filters could allow for pixel values to be read. This could potentially allow for text values to be read across domains leading to information disclosure.,[711043]
17.0.7,['CVE-2013-1692'],2013-54,Data in the body of XHR HEAD requests leads to CSRF attacks,Johnathan Kuskos,High,Security researcher Johnathan Kuskos reported that Firefox is sending data in the body of  XMLHttpRequest (XHR) HEAD requests which goes agains the XHR specification. This can potentially be used for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against sites which do not distinguish between HEAD and POST requests.,[866915]
17.0.7,['CVE-2013-1690'],2013-53,Execution of unmapped memory through onreadystatechange event,Nils,Critical,Security researcher Nils reported that specially crafted web content using the onreadystatechange event and reloading of pages could sometimes cause a crash when unmapped memory is executed.

17.0.7,['CVE-2013-1687'],2013-51,Privileged content access and execution via XBL,Mariusz Mlynski,Critical,Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is possible to compile a user-defined function in the XBL scope of a specific element and then trigger an event within this scope to run code. In some circumstances when this code is run it can access content protected by System Only Wrappers (SOW) and chrome-privileged pages. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) can be bypassed by web content to access privileged methods leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack from privileged pages.,"[863933, 866823]"
17.0.7,"['CVE-2013-1684', 'CVE-2013-1685', 'CVE-2013-1686']",2013-50,Memory corruption found using Address Sanitizer,Abhishek Arya,Critical,Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series of use-after-free problems rated critical as security issues in shipped software.
