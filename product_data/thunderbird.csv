31.03,['CVE-2014-1595'],2014-90,Apple CoreGraphics framework on OS X 10.10 logging input data to /tmp directory,Kent Howard,High,Security researcher Kent Howard reported an Apple issue present in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) where log files are created by the CoreGraphics framework of OS X in the /tmp local directory. These log files contain a record of all inputs into Mozilla programs during their operation. In versions of OS X from versions 10.6 through 10.9 the CoreGraphics had this logging ability but it was turned off by default. In OS X 10.10 this logging was turned on by default for some applications that use a custom memory allocator such as jemalloc because of an initialization bug in the framework. This issue has been addressed in Mozilla products by explicitly turning off the framework's logging of input events. On vulnerable systems this issue can result in private data such as usernames passwords and other inputed data being saved to a log file on the local system.,[1092855]

The heap buffer overflow is in ElementAnimations when data is read off of end of an array and then pointers are dereferenced. The bad cast happens when nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is called with frames in aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column group frames.

These applications have had known vulnerabilities exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Thunderbird) so in this release Thunderbird has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them.This bug only affects Thunderbird on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.,[1773717]

102,['CVE-2022-2226'],2022-26,An email with a mismatching OpenPGP signature date was accepted as valid,Nickolay Olshevsky,moderate,An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when the signature was created. When displaying an email that contains a digital signature the email's date will be shown. If the dates were different then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having an invalid signature. If an attacker performed a replay attack in which an old email with old contents are resent at a later time it could lead the victim to believe that the statements in the email are current. Fixed versions of Thunderbird will require that the signature's date roughly matches the displayed date of the email.,[1775441]

10,['CVE-2012-0447'],2012-06,Uninitialized memory appended when encoding icon images may cause information disclosure,Tim Abraldes,High,Mozilla developer Tim Abraldes reported that when encoding images as image/vnd.microsoft.icon the resulting data was always a fixed size with uninitialized memory appended as padding beyond the size of the actual image. This is the result of mImageBufferSize in the encoder being initialized with a value different than the size of the source image. There is the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory being appended to a PNG image when converted fron an ICO format image. This sensitive data may then be disclosed in the resulting image.,[710079]

Since web pages can normally detect key events through script and most users have scripting enabled this does not present a risk for most users. In contexts where the user knows scripting is disabled (reading mail for example or NoScript users) this could allow a malicious web page to fool a user into interacting with a prompt thinking it came from the browser or mail program.,[704482]

08,['CVE-2011-3653'],2011-51,Cross-origin image theft on Mac with integrated Intel GPU,Claus Wahlers,High,Claus Wahlers reported that random images from GPU memory were showing up in WebGL textures. Once incorporated into the WebGL graphics it is possible for a site to programatically read the image data and potentially gain sensitive data from other things that had been displayed earlier. This problem is due to a bug in the driver for Intel integrated GPUs on recent Mac OS X hardware and the problem can be seen in WebGL implementations from other vendors.

08,['CVE-2011-3648'],2011-47,Potential XSS against sites using Shift-JIS,Yosuke Hasegawa,High,Yosuke Hasegawa reported that the Mozilla browser engine mishandled invalid sequences in the Shift-JIS encoding. When encountering an invalid pair Mozilla would turn the entire two-byte sequence into a single unknown character rather than an unknown character followed by a valid single-byte character. On some sites attackers may have been able to end their input with the first byte of a two byte sequence; when that input was later put into a page context it might cause the following delimiter (such as a double-quote) to be consumed breaking the format of the page.  Depending on the page this could potentially be used to steal data or inject script into the page.,[690225]
07,['CVE-2011-3000'],2011-39,Defense against multiple Location headers due to CRLF Injection,Ian Graham,Moderate,Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that when multiple Location headers were present in a redirect response  Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers: Mozilla would use the second Location header while Chrome and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two copies of this header with different values could be a symptom of a CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most commonly it is the Location header itself that is vulnerable to the response splitting and therefore the copy preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be the malicious one. It is possible however that the first copy was the injected one depending on the nature of the server vulnerability.,[655389]

07,['CVE-2011-3670'],2012-02,Overly permissive IPv6 literal syntax,Gregory Fleischer,Low,For historical reasons Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web addresses containing square brackets around the host. If this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address Firefox attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name. Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were previously accepted.,[504014]

For some file types this would be merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file types have powerful scripting capabilities.
