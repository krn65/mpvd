Instead the NSS client will take the EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation the browser thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange but has been silently downgraded to a non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result if False Start is enabled the browser will start sending data encrypted under these non-forward-secret connection keys. This issue was fixed in NSS version 3.19.1.,[1086145]

09,['CVE-2011-3658'],2011-55,nsSVGValue out-of-bounds access,regenrecht via TippingPoint's ZDI,Critical,Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a flaw in the Mozilla SVG implementation could result in an out-of-bounds memory access if SVG elements were removed during a DOMAttrModified event handler.,[708186]
09,['CVE-2011-3663'],2011-56,Key detection without JavaScript via SVG animation,Mario Heiderich,Moderate,Security researcher Mario Heiderich reported it was possible to use SVG animation accessKey events to detect key strokes even when JavaScript was disabled. Since web pages can normally detect key events through script and most users have scripting enabled this does not present a risk for most users. In contexts where the user knows scripting is disabled (reading mail for example or NoScript users) this could allow a malicious web page to fool a user into interacting with a prompt thinking it came from the browser or mail program.,[704482]
09,['CVE-2011-3664'],2011-57,Crash when plugin removes itself on Mac OS X,Richard Bateman,High,FireBreath developer Richard Bateman reported a crash on Mac OS X that occurred when a plugin deletes its containing DOM frame during a call from that frame. The observed symptom is a null dereference but we cannot rule out the possibility that content from a scriptable plugin such as Flash could find a way to dereference a more useful address and exploit it.,[649079]
09,['CVE-2011-3671'],2012-41,Use-after-free in nsHTMLSelectElement,regenrecht,Critical,Security researcher regenrecht reported a flaw that affected Firefox versions 4 through 8 via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. This flaw is a use-after-free in nsHTMLSelectElement when the parent node of the element is no longer active and could allow for possible remote code execution.,[739343]
09,['CVE-2011-3665'],2011-58,Crash scaling <video> to extreme sizes,sczimmer,Critical,sczimmer reported a crash when scaling an OGG <video> element to extreme sizes.,[701259]
08,['CVE-2011-3650'],2011-49,Memory corruption while profiling using Firebug,Marc Schoenefeld,Critical,Marc Schoenefeld reported a crash when using Firebug to profile a JavaScript file with many functions. It may be possible to trigger this crash without the use of debugging APIs and if so this could be exploitable.,[674776]
08,['CVE-2011-3648'],2011-47,Potential XSS against sites using Shift-JIS,Yosuke Hasegawa,High,Yosuke Hasegawa reported that the Mozilla browser engine mishandled invalid sequences in the Shift-JIS encoding. When encountering an invalid pair Mozilla would turn the entire two-byte sequence into a single unknown character rather than an unknown character followed by a valid single-byte character. On some sites attackers may have been able to end their input with the first byte of a two byte sequence; when that input was later put into a page context it might cause the following delimiter (such as a double-quote) to be consumed breaking the format of the page.  Depending on the page this could potentially be used to steal data or inject script into the page.,[690225]
08,['CVE-2011-3652'],2011-48,Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:8.0),,Critical,Mozilla developers fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. Security researcher Rh0 reported a potentially exploitable crash due to unchecked allocation failure.,[682727]

08,['CVE-2011-3654'],2011-48,Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:8.0),,Critical,Mozilla developers fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. Security researcher Aki Helin reported a potentially exploitable crash with an SVG <mpath> linking to a non-SVG element.,[694953]
08,['CVE-2011-3649'],2011-50,Cross-origin data theft using canvas and Windows D2D,Bas Schouten,High,"Mozilla developer Bas Schouten reported that the introduction of the ""Azure"" graphics back-end on Windows in Firefox 7 re-introduced the cross-origin data theft issue reported by nasalislarvatus3000 as described in  MFSA 2011-29.",[655836]
08,['CVE-2011-3653'],2011-51,Cross-origin image theft on Mac with integrated Intel GPU,Claus Wahlers,High,Claus Wahlers reported that random images from GPU memory were showing up in WebGL textures. Once incorporated into the WebGL graphics it is possible for a site to programatically read the image data and potentially gain sensitive data from other things that had been displayed earlier. This problem is due to a bug in the driver for Intel integrated GPUs on recent Mac OS X hardware and the problem can be seen in WebGL implementations from other vendors. Mozilla has implemented a work-around to prevent this from happening with this hardware-driver combination.,[684882]
08,['CVE-2011-3655'],2011-52,Code execution via NoWaiverWrapper,moz_bug_r_a4,Critical,Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that an internal privilege check failed to respect the NoWaiverWrappers introduced with Firefox 4. This could result in elevated privilege being granted to web content.,[674182]
07,['CVE-2011-3670'],2012-02,Overly permissive IPv6 literal syntax,Gregory Fleischer,Low,For historical reasons Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web addresses containing square brackets around the host. If this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address Firefox attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name. Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were previously accepted.,[504014]
07,['CVE-2011-3005'],2011-44,Use after free reading OGG headers,sczimmer,Critical,sczimmer reported that Firefox crashed when loading a particular .ogg file. This was due to a use-after-free condition and could potentially be exploited to install malware.,[675747]

07,"['CVE-2011-2372', 'CVE-2011-3001']",2011-40,Code installation through holding down Enter,Mariusz Mlynski,Critical,Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could convince a user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a game or test perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a download dialog where the held key would then activate the default Open action. For some file types this would be merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would provide an avenue for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in applications not normally exposed to potentially hostile internet content.,"[657462, 662309, 663899, 672485]"
07,['CVE-2011-3000'],2011-39,Defense against multiple Location headers due to CRLF Injection,Ian Graham,Moderate,Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that when multiple Location headers were present in a redirect response  Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers: Mozilla would use the second Location header while Chrome and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two copies of this header with different values could be a symptom of a CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most commonly it is the Location header itself that is vulnerable to the response splitting and therefore the copy preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be the malicious one. It is possible however that the first copy was the injected one depending on the nature of the server vulnerability.,[655389]

Because some plugins use the value of window.location to determine the page origin this could fool the plugin into granting the plugin content access to another site or the local file system in violation of the Same Origin Policy. This flaw allows circumvention of the fix added for MFSA 2010-10.",[665548]
