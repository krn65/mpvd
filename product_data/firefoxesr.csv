Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.,[1616661]
68.06,['CVE-2019-20503'],2020-09,Out of bounds reads in sctp_load_addresses_from_init,Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero,moderate,The inputs to sctp_load_addresses_from_init are verified by sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters; however the two functions handled parameter bounds differently resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.,[1613765]

This required Firefox to be configured as the default handler for a given file type and for a file downloaded to be opened in a third party application that insufficiently sanitized URL data. In that situation clicking a link in the third party application could have been used to retrieve and execute files whose location was supplied through command line arguments.

Normally when a user enters the URL to an add-on directly in the addressbar warning prompts are bypassed because it is the result of direct user action. He discovered that a data: URL could be manipulated on a loaded page to simulate this direct user input of the add-on's URL which would result in a bypassing of the install permission prompt. He also reported that in the absence of the permission prompt it is possible to cause the actual installation prompt to appear above another site's location by causing a page navigation immediately after triggering add-on installation. This could manipulate a user into falsely believing a trusted site (such as addons.mozilla.org) has initiated the installation.
